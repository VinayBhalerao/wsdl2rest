Release Notes
-------------

WSDL2Rest 0.5 is the first release that builds on the [wsdl2rest](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wsdl2rest) sourceforge project.

We migrated this project to a maven based build and added support for simple CXF generated RPC & Document Literal WSDL definitions.
For complex type definitions we delegate to CXF [WSDL to Java](http://cxf.apache.org/docs/wsdl-to-java.html).

For details please see the [0.5 Milestone](https://github.com/tdiesler/wsdl2rest/issues?q=milestone%3A0.5).

Enjoy
